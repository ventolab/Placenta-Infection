README

This folder has the scripts to run the differential expression analysis.

Each folder corresponds to one cell compartment and contains the code to:
1) Run limma (differential expression)
2) Filter the differentially expressed genes
3) Plot the heatmaps for visualisation: the scripts heatmaps1_SelectedGenesTables_R.ipynb have the code to extract the tables used for the heatmap plots in Figures 2, 3, 4 and S5.
