# Placenta-Infection
Repository dedicated to harbour all the scripts used to analyse the data product of our Placenta Infection experiments.


The single-cell RNA-seq data from infected placenta can be browsed and visualised in the [Reproductive Cell Atlas](https://www.reproductivecellatlas.org).

This repository has the following sections of codes:

- `Explants_scRNAseq`:  single-cell RNAseq analysis of placental explants compared to fresh tissue.
- `Explants_cellHashing_scRNAseq`:  single-cell RNAseq analysis of independent placental regions processed using cell hashing.
- `PlacentaInfection_scRNAseq`:  single-cell RNAseq analysis of infected placental explants.
- `PlacentaInfection_snRNAseq`:  single-nuclei RNAseq analysis of placental explants infected with *Plasmodium falciparum*.
- `Plasmodium_falciparum_scRNAseq`:  single-cell RNAseq analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites.
