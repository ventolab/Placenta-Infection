README

This folder contains the scripts to analyse the single-nuclei RNAseq data from the infected placental explants.

The order to run this analysis is:
1) `data_integration`: scripts to read, integrate and annotate the data.
2) `diffGeneExpression`: scripts to run differential expression analysis.
3) `plots_forFigures`: scripts to generate the plots included in the article's Figures.
